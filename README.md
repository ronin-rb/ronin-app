ronin-app is a small web application that is meant to be ran locally by the
user. It provides a web interface to [ronin-support], [ronin-repos], [ronin-db],
[ronin-payloads], [ronin-exploits], as well as automating
[ronin-nmap], [ronin-masscan], and [ronin-web-spider].

## Features

* Provides a web interface to explore and search the [ronin database][ronin-db].
* Allows managing [ronin-repos] from the web interface.
* Allows listing and building the built-in or installed 3rd-party
  [payloads][ronin-payloads].
* Allows listing installed 3rd-party [exploits][ronin-exploits].
* Supports automating [nmap] and [masscan] scans and importing their results
  into the [ronin database][ronin-db].
* Supports automating [spidering websites][ronin-web-spider] and importing all
  visited URLs into the [ronin database][ronin-db].
* Small memory footprint (~184K).
* Fast (~1.251ms response time).

## Synopsis

Options:
    -V, --version                    Prints the version and exits
    -H, --host IP                    The host to listen on (Default: localhost)
    -p, --port PORT                  The port to listen on (Default: 1337)
        --db NAME                    The ronin-db database to connect to
        --db-uri URI                 The ronin-db database URI to connect to
    -h, --help                       Print help information

Starts the ronin web app
```

```shell
$ ronin-app
```

**Note:** the `ronin-app` command will automatically open a browser for
http://localhost:1337, if ran in a real terminal.

## Requirements

* [libsqlite3][sqlite]
* [redis-server][redis] >= 6.2
* [nmap]
* [masscan]
* [Ruby] >= 3.0.0

## Security

* This app is intended to be ran locally.
* All HTML output is escaped with `Rack::Utils.escape_html`.
* All HTTP params are validated using [dry-validation].

## Development

1. [Fork It!](https://github.com/ronin-rb/ronin/fork)
2. Clone It!
3. `cd ronin-app`
4. `./scripts/setup`
5. `git checkout -b my_feature`
6. Code It!
7. Test It - `bundle exec rake spec`
8. Try It - `./scripts/server` then visit http://localhost:1337/
9. Push It - `git push origin my_feature`

### docker-compose

You can also use [docker-compose] to build and run the app:

```shell
$ docker-compose build --build-arg RONIN_UID=$(id -u) --build-arg RONIN_GID=$(id -g)
$ docker-compose up
```

**Note:** In order for `docker-compose` to use [ronin-db] and [ronin-repos]
files, in `~/.local/share/ronin-db` and `~/.cache/ronin-repos`, the Docker
container user must have the same `UID` and `GID` as the host's user.

  can be called within the views.
* `lib/ronin/app/types.rb` - Defines custom [dry-types].
* `lib/ronin/app/types/` - Contains additional custom types.
* `lib/ronin/app/validations/` - Contains [dry-validation]s logic for validating
